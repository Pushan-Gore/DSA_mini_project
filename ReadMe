Project : LZW Compression ( My Version )

	Compressing:

	The Project uses the LZW compression algorithm (My version) to compress a "single"* file.
	I have used my modified version of LZW algorithm (similar to LZ77) for this project.
	The algorithm reads characters from the file and writes them to the dictionary.
	
	Compression algorithm is:
   	BEGIN:
		s = next input character
		while not EOF
			{ c = next input character
			  if s + c exists in dictionary 
				s = s + c
			  else {
				output the code for s;
				add string s + c to the dictionary with a new code
				s = c
			  }
			}
		output the code for s
   	END

	Check "./project --help" for more information.
	The program takes a single file for compression and compresses it into a '.mtz' format file.(With same name)
	Example: 
		./project -c example
		>> example.mtz will be created.

	
	Decompressing or extracting:

	Extraction algorithm is :
 	  BEGIN:
		s = NILL
   		while not EOF {
			k = next input code
			entry = dictionary entry for k
			//exception case
			if(entry == NULL)
				entry = s + s[0]
			output entry
			if(s != NILL) 
				add string s + entry[0] to dictionary with a new code
			s = entry
		}
	   END
 
	Check "./project --help" for more information.
	The program takes a single file for decompressing or extracting. The file should have a '.mtz' extension.
	The outputed file will have the same name without the '.mtz' extension.
	Example:
		./project -x example.mtz
		>> example will be created.
	
		
	*(Multiple files are not compressed. See the 'expected final project' section.)	

Limitations and Current errors: 

	The program easily compresses and extracts "text files" without any error. 
	For very large files it doesn't completely extracts the compressed file. 
	Compresses the binary files but doesn't extract it fully.

Expected Final Project:

	The Final project will compress and extract ANY (Text and Binary) file.
	Also it will compress and extract MULTIPLE files (compressed into a single file)
